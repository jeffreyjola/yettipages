<h2>BEFORE YOU BUY | UPDATE</h2>
<p>Before making your purchase decision, please take a moment to read this message, especially if you're upgrading from the previous version of our software.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I'd like to extend my apologies for any past shortcomings in terms of support and updates. Rest assured, I am committed to improving this moving forward.</p>
<p>If you are transitioning from version 2 of our software, please be aware that you will need to perform a clean installation. This is because the codebase has undergone significant changes and won't support a simple file replacement. Ensure you do a fresh install from version 2.</p>
<p>Starting from version 3, I have made some changes regarding licensing. PayPal is no longer included with the regular license. To offer this product as a Software as a Service (SaaS) to your users, you must now have an extended license.</p>
<p>Your purchase includes 8 block layouts. If you wish to access the remaining blocks seen in the demo, you'll need to acquire the block addon separately or opt for the extended license.</p>
<p>Additionally, the digital card addon is not pre-included in your purchase. You can purchase it separately or, again, choose the extended license option.</p>
<p>I appreciate your understanding and support as I work to enhance your experience with my software.</p>
